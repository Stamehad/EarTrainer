SoundFonts
==========

Place a suitable piano SoundFont file (e.g., GrandPiano.sf2) in `./soundfonts/` at the project root.

Update the `audio.soundfont_path` in `eartrainer/config/defaults.yml` if you use a different file name or location.

Licensing: Ensure you have the rights to use and distribute any SoundFont files you include. Many SoundFonts are licensed and not redistributable.
