# Roadmap / Known Gaps

Use this checklist to track near-term improvements.

- [ ] Melodic minor (classical): natural-minor descent for scale playback
- [ ] Seventh-chord drill: use maj7/min7/dom7 voicings; map qualities per scale
- [ ] Cadence selector: CLI/config toggle (cadence | scale) per session/drill
- [ ] Result persistence: SQLite backend, history queries, summaries by drill/key/register
- [ ] Mistake policies: OneRetryThenReveal, PartialSequence; penalties/hints
- [ ] Randomness: cooldown window >1; weighted exposure balancing; config knobs
- [ ] Drone: auto-restart policy tuning; optional duck on questions; more templates/instruments
- [ ] CLI: history command; reference-mode flag; instrument/note-range overrides; seed echo; verbose/explain
- [ ] VoicingBank: inversion tags; per-instrument banks; config overrides; more chord types
- [ ] Chord drill: allow answering by degree/Roman-numeral/quality; symbol display; retries
- [ ] Interval drill: add interval identification (harmonic/melodic)
- [ ] Melody drill: add short melodic dictation; partial-credit grading
- [ ] Events: richer app-level events; GUI adapters
- [ ] Tests: unit tests for theory mappings, selector, drone timer, CLI
- [ ] Docs: polish diagrams, add examples; contributor guide
